# stock-price-predication-with-sentiment
"Building and training machine learning models for financial markets. Currently exploring LSTM networks for stock price prediction using sentiment analysis."

"Data scientist focused on time-series analysis and financial modeling. My projects involve using deep learning with a focus on sentiment data."

"Leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK to predict stock movements. Check out my work on combining technical indicators with news sentiment."

Detailed Description
"I am a data scientist and machine learning enthusiast specializing in quantitative finance and time-series forecasting. My work focuses on building and evaluating predictive models for stock market analysis. I use a combination of technical indicators, such as RSI and MACD, and natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis from news headlines. My models are often built using TensorFlow and Keras, with a specific interest in LSTMs for their ability to handle sequential data. This repository features a complete pipeline for data fetching (from yfinance and Yahoo RSS feeds), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation."

Key elements from your code to highlight:
Libraries: yfinance, tensorflow, nltk (specifically VADER for sentiment analysis), pandas, scikit-learn.


Methodologies: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for forecasting , sentiment analysis using VADER , chronological data splitting for robust model evaluation.



Domain: Quantitative finance, time-series analysis, stock market prediction.


Data Sources: Yahoo Finance for price data and Yahoo RSS feeds for headlines.



Project Goal: Predicting stock price movement (up/down):
